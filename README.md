# About the developer
Hey there I'm Abdelrhman Elgebaly a CS student at the German Univerity in Cairo (GUC). To be honest I'm obsessed with several things. Two of which are Watching anime and coding.
I started thinking "wait a minute, why not start a project that combines two of the most things that I really admire". That's when kemitsu no Yaiba website came into picture.

# About the project
It is a pretty much simple website that does nothing but giving some simple information about an anime called Kemitsu-no-Yaiba or Demon Slayer.
The website was buiilt using HTML, CSS and JS. It is not supposed to a website with Backend features. However, I am looking forward to adding a little bit of backend stuff for the contact us page
